#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This one is a O(log n). As the size of n increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a alil bit of a slowwer rate

b)This one is a O(n^c) As the size of the input increases, the space used will grow at a faster rate;

c)This one is a O(n) as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used is will grow at the same rate

## Exercise II

#Understanding
n-story building
many eggs

#pseudocode

if egg is at floor x or at floor greater then floor x  
 then egg will eqaul to break

or elase if egg at is at floor less then floor x
then egg will equal to not break
